There are 2 ways:

1. If your platform has cable connector, then you can use "QRCT" to test, you need to compile "Qcmbr" and start the program.

2. myftm instruction test

   1) Put the file "myftm arm32" file into the board's system/bin menu and rename it "Myftm"
 
   2) replace the bdwlan30.bin of the board with the "8274B-PR 2XXXXXX.bin" file from the attachment. ( search the board file and put them into the same file folder).
